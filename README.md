## Description
You play as a person sick of Lorem Ipsum, willing to do anything to get rid of it. Mooie’s are just cute lil ghosts. They carry the spirit of Lorem Ipsum forward, and you don’t like that. 
So, on a quest to finally kill this wretched practice, you set off on a journey to destroy all Mooies.

The name of the project, ‘Malorum’ comes from the book from which Lorem Ipsum originates.

Lorem Ipsum is collection of words from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, randomly arranged to be used as placeholder text. Just like this random arrangement, the ghosts in our game show up saying random popular words from the actual Lorem Ipsum. While Researching, we found that a lot of the newer generation believes that Lorem Ipsum is unnecessary. 

The technology used in this project are: Python, Pygame, Wick Editor.

Whenever the player clicks the attack button the animation is played, and the Mooie takes damage. Once every Mooie is defeated, you win. The order in which the ghosts show up is completely random.
